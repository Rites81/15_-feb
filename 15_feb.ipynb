    "## Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python is a module that allows you to run multiple processes concurrently by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores. It is useful for CPU-bound tasks (tasks that require significant CPU time, such as complex calculations) because each process runs independently and can execute code in parallel, unlike multithreading, which is limited by Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel execution: Multiprocessing allows tasks to run in parallel on different CPU cores, improving performance for CPU-intensive tasks.\n",
    "Avoids GIL limitations: Unlike threads, each process has its own memory space, which helps in scenarios where the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) restricts multithreaded execution in Python.\n",
    "## Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "Feature\tMultiprocessing\tMultithreading\n",
    "Definition\tRuns multiple processes, each with its own memory space.\tRuns multiple threads within the same process and memory space.\n",
    "Memory\tEach process has its own memory and data space (independent memory).\tThreads share the same memory space.\n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\tNot affected by the GIL, allows full parallelism.\tAffected by the GIL, which limits true parallel execution.\n",
    "Best for\tCPU-bound tasks (e.g., complex calculations, data processing).\tI/O-bound tasks (e.g., file reading/writing, network operations).\n",
    "Overhead\tMore overhead due to process creation and memory allocation.\tLess overhead compared to processes.\n",
    "Crash impact\tA process crash doesn't affect other processes.\tA thread crash may affect the entire process.\n",
    "## Q3. Write a Python code to create a process using the multiprocessing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_message():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello from the child process!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_message)\n",
    "    process.start()  # Start the process\n",
    "    process.join()   # Wait for the process to finish\n",
    "    print(\"Process finished\")\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A child process is created using multiprocessing.Process().\n",
    "The print_message function is executed in the child process.\n",
    "## Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in Python? Why is it used?\n",
    "A multiprocessing pool in Python is a collection of worker processes that execute tasks concurrently. The Pool class provides a convenient way to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple input values using multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient management of worker processes: Pools automatically manage the distribution of tasks to the worker processes.\n",
    "Parallel execution: It allows the execution of tasks in parallel, which is useful for tasks that need to be repeated many times (e.g., map-reduce operations).\n",
    "Scalability: You can easily scale the number of worker processes based on the number of CPU cores available.\n",
    "## Q5. How can we create a pool of worker processes in Python using the multiprocessing module?\n",
    "You can create a pool of worker processes using the Pool class from the multiprocessing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(num):\n",
    "    return num * num\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)  # Create a pool with 4 worker processes\n",
    "    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "    result = pool.map(square, numbers)  # Apply the function to each number\n",
    "    pool.close()  # Close the pool to prevent further tasks\n",
    "    pool.join()   # Wait for all worker processes to finish\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "In this example, a pool of 4 worker processes is created, and the square function is applied to a list of numbers in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6. Write a Python program to create 4 processes, each process should print a different number using the multiprocessing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_number(num):\n",
    "    print(f\"Process ID: {multiprocessing.current_process().pid}, Number: {num}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    processes = []\n",
    "    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create 4 processes\n",
    "    for num in numbers:\n",
    "        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_number, args=(num,))\n",
    "        processes.append(process)\n",
    "        process.start()  # Start the process\n",
    "\n",
